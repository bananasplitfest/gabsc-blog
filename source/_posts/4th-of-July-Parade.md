Latrobe celebrated a milestone this year with the city's 50th annual Fourth of July festivities. Our 2019 Banana Split Princess and her court rode on a float decked out in red, white, blue, and ICE CREAM! <!-- more -->The night before was build day. After the rain stopped, celebration committee members, chamber staff, and volunteers assembled everything. The time and attention to detail paid off when we got first place in the parade's float competition!
