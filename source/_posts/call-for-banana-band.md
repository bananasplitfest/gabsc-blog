Calling all instrument-players! If you want to be a part of our celebration‚Äôs parade, sign-ups are open for the 2019 Banana Band. No matter what instrument you play, we‚Äôd love to have you join us as the band marches around downtown on their way to Valley Dairy via Strickler‚Äôs Way to order a split.<!-- more -->

Even if you don't have the gift of playing an instrument, we would still love to see you at the Great American Banana Split Celebration on August 23-25. As you see the Banana Band playing through downtown join in their parade through the street.
