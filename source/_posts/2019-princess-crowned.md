First, we want to thank everyone that came out for the first-ever Banana Split Princess Pageant at Latrobe Elementary School. The pageant was a massive success and the girls loved making memories with new friends. They had been rehearsing since April,<!-- more --> going through their opening routine, personal introductions, formal wear segments and preparing for interviews with the judges on their big day. Not only did the girls get to make new memories on stage, but they got to share their dreams and goals with the judges and attendees. Every contestant should be proud of the work they put in!

Members of the Banana Split Court includes:
    4th Runner Up ‚Äì Karlee Clark, Latrobe Elementary School
    3rd Runner Up ‚Äì Sadie Bridge, Latrobe Elementary School
    2nd Runner Up ‚Äì Emma Hovater, Mountain View Elementary School
    1st Runner Up ‚Äì Kathryn Thomas, Grandview Elementary School

The winner of the **2019 Banana Split Princess** crown is **Jannie Van Horn**, a student at Baggaley Elementary School.

Jannie will reign as Banana Split Princess for one year before passing the crown in 2020. Until then, you can catch her at several different community events, including Fred Rogers Family Day, the Latrobe Fourth of July Parade, and other special events all over Westmoreland County. Of course, she will also make an appearance at our 2019 Great American Banana Split Celebration on August 23-25. Hope to see you there!
