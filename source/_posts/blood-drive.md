Today (June 14) is World Blood Donor Day and its seems fitting to announce that is celebration is partnering with the American Red Cross for a blood donation drive during the Great American Banana Split Celebration. The drive will take place on the first day of the celebration, Friday, August 23, and begins at 1:00 PM at Trinity Lutheran Church.<!-- more -->

Isaac McDaniel, event director for the celebration, is pleased to be able to add another activity to the schedule. "We've really looked to include the businesses, organizations, and churches in downtown Latrobe to the celebration this year. When we found out Trinity Lutheran had hosted drives before it made perfect sense to approach them." 

Cletus McConville, Account Manager of Donor Recruitment for the American Red Cross, told us just how donating blood can save lives. ‚ÄúEvery 3 seconds someone needs blood‚Ä¶One blood donation can save up to 3 lives. A whole blood donor can give every 56 days, but whole blood has a shelf life of only 42 days, the need is constant.‚Äù

The goal of the drive is to help save lives by adding a good deed to a fun festival. ‚ÄúThe Banana Split Celebration can help us communicate this need to a large audience and encourage new donors to make a lifesaving blood donation,‚Äù said McConville. ‚ÄúCome to give blood and then have some fun at the festival.‚Äù

Blood donations help to save lives and restore hope to those affected. McConville challenges donors to give blood multiple times per year. ‚ÄúOver 35% of the population is eligible to give blood yet only 3% actually do.‚Äù

If you're a first time donor, or its been a while since you last donated, you can find answers to common questions on the Donate Blood pages of the Red Cross website. We hope to see you at the blood drive on Friday, August 23!
