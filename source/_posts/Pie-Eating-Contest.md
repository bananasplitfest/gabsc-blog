For as much as we would love to host a banana split eating contest, ice cream tends to get a bit too messy when it’s left outside in the August sun. Fortunately, we have another sweet eating contest for people to participate in – the Banana Cream Pie Eating Contest! A time-honored tradition, contestants will be racing against the clock to be the first to consume an entire banana-cream pie. That means the crust too! This year, don’t miss the Latrobe vs. Derry pre-event, when students from the two high schools will face off against each other in their own intense pie-eating showdown.
For the main event, the contestant with the strongest gut gets to have their name inscribed on the championship belt, along with a $50 Eat ‘N Park gift card and a certificate for a free Eat ‘N Park pie every month!
The contest will take place on Saturday, August 24 from 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. on Stage 2 at the celebration. Sign-up details will be available soon.
