Latrobe is home to some really special things but the sweetest is, by far, being the birthplace of the banana split. My name is Isaac and I‚Äôm excited to be the Event Director for the Great American Banana Split Celebration. What will be fun for me is introducing many of the hard-working individuals and organizations working to plan the activities and entertainment for you, your family, and friends.

This is the sixth year of the <!-- more -->celebration. The first year, 2013, was more of a local event where we unveiled a Pennsylvania Historical Marker at the site of the former Tassell‚Äôs (later renamed Stickler‚Äôs) Pharmacy. Then it hit us, ‚ÄúEveryone should know the banana split came from Latrobe!‚Äù And so we grew.
In the coming weeks, I‚Äôll share more but here are some highlights to whet your appetite:

+ **A third space for musical entertainment:** This gives our entertainment chair, Bob Demangone, more time and space to book more acts. Clapping and singing along is encouraged! And when you‚Äôre really into the song, grab a partner and dance along.

+ **Banana Split Princess Pageant:** Girls ages 8-12 from Greater Latrobe, Derry Area, and Ligonier Valley school districts are eligible to participate in the pageant with the chance to be named the Banana Split Princess and receive a scholarship to a summer camp of her choice. Georgia Teppert knows her way around the pageant circuit and will be organizing the first one for the celebration. Thanks Georgia!

+ **More to do, all weekend long:** This program area that will be greatly expanded this year. We‚Äôve had plenty of scheduled events for young kids in the past but what about teens? Young adults? Empty nesters? Tawnya Rockwell, the activities chair, is coming up with ideas to make sure everyone has activities throughout the weekend. Expect the schedule to be packed from start to finish.

+ **Classic and unique cars:** We‚Äôre once again happy to support the efforts of the American Cancer Society‚Äôs Relay for Life Latrobe by having them as a beneficiary of the annual car cruise. Over the years we‚Äôve seen some truly unique vehicles come out to participate. Leading the efforts here is Sarah Crispin-Thomas whose State Farm office also sponsors the activity.

Of course, some things you just don‚Äôt change. Valley Dairy stays as true to the original 1904 recipe as possible, making it the most authentic version anywhere. So whether you‚Äôre planning on splitting one with your honey-bun or it‚Äôs your first time digging in, save room for the reason the celebration happens ‚Äî a banana split!

Circle it on your wall calendar. Add it in your phone. RSVP on our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/858045807917582/">Facebook event</a>. Invite your friends. The Great American Banana Split Celebration happens August 23-25 in downtown Latrobe, PA.
